# Automated Swipe2Care Donations

## Motivation

Northeastern University's Dining Service provider, commonly known as NUDining, runs a program called [Swipe2Care](https://www.nudining.com/public/intentionally-reducing-waste), described as follows: 

> "Swipe2Care is a combined initiative from Student Government Association, Dining Services, and Student Affairs to provide a platform for students to donate their meal swipes to other students. The program is designed to allow students to seamlessly contribute meals from their meal plan while providing a confidential and efficient method for students–who may be having difficulty–to request their next meal."

While it's not publicly known how many students take advantage of this program, NUDining made it clear in a recent email to the entire Boston-based student body that there is currently a high demand for donated meal swipes. 

At the end of every week, hundreds –if not thousands– of unused, **already paid for** meal swipes expire, generating pure profit for NUDining. The obvious thing to do would be to automatically donate these unused meals to the Swipe2Care meal bank, which NUDining has not done. In fact, as absurd as it may sound, the meal donation website already includes functionality for automatic meal donations, but it's intentionally disabled.
